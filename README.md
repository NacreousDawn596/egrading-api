## 🛠 Requirements

```bash
pip install requests urllib3 g4f
```

---

## 🚀 Quick Start

```python
from egrading_api import Student

# Initialize client

print(exams)
```

🔍 Returns:

exam_id = "123456"
exam_data = student.getExamData(exam_id)

print(exam_data)
```

## 🤖 Auto-Solve MCQs using ChatGPT

Once you extract the questions from the exam:

```python
questions = exam_data["questions"]

answers = student.answerQuestionsUsingChatGPT(questions)
print(answers)
```

### ✅ Output Format

```python
{
  "Q1": [2],
  "Q2": [1, 3],
  "Q3": [4]
}
```

* 🟢 Always returns **lists**
* 🟢 Supports **multiple correct answers**
* 🟢 Indexes are **1-based**

## 🧠 How the AI Solving Works

* Questions are split into smart chunks
* Each chunk is sent to ChatGPT
* The model is forced to return:

  * ✅ A **raw Python dictionary**
  * ✅ No markdown
  * ✅ No explanations
* Output is:

  * Parsed
  * Normalized
  * Merged into a clean final result

---

## 🔐 Authentication System

The wrapper handles:

* ✅ Access token stored in headers
* ✅ Refresh token stored in cookies
* ✅ Automatic session reuse
* ✅ No manual token handling needed
